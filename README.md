## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Positioning background images was something I struggled in the last challenge. For this one I think I made some progress. And it was really nice to learn how to put an overlay over the image.

### Continued development

Once again, I need to learn how to use SASS/SCSS apart from frameworks like VueJS.

### Useful resources

- [W3School - Background property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background.asp) - This link comes with a list of the parameters you can use for background. There is a shortcut, but for achieve the mastery maybe it's better use each property separately.
